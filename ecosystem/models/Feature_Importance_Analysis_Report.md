## Recommendations

### 1. **Model Interpretation**

Each cluster represents a distinct **ecosystem archetype** that should be analyzed and applied separately:

- Use **Cluster 0 models** for complex, interaction-rich environments
- Use **Cluster 1 models** for responsive, light-driven systems
- Use **Cluster 2 models** for structure-dominated mature forests

### 2. **Feature Engineering Priorities**

- **For Cluster 0**: Focus on interaction terms and complex environmental relationships
- **For Cluster 1**: Emphasize lag features and light response timing
- **For Cluster 2**: Prioritize structural metrics and rate-of-change calculations

### 3. **Data Collection Strategies**

Different ecosystem types require different monitoring emphases:

- **Complex systems**: Multi-variable environmental sensors
- **Lag-responsive systems**: High-frequency light measurements
- **Structure-driven systems**: Detailed structural surveys + dynamic monitoring

## Conclusions

The feature mapping integration has successfully revealed **three distinct ecosystem strategies** for sap flow regulation. This analysis demonstrates that:

1. **No single model fits all ecosystems** - different strategies require different approaches
2. **Feature importance varies dramatically** by ecosystem type
3. **Interpretable ML** is crucial for understanding ecosystem function
4. **Our feature mapping system** enables powerful model interpretation

This analysis provides a foundation for **ecosystem-specific model application** and **targeted data collection strategies** for improved sap flow prediction across diverse forest environments.
