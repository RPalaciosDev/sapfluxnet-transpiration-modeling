QGIS QUICK START - SAPFLUXNET Analysis
=====================================

📁 YOUR FILES ARE HERE:
C:\Users\rpala\Downloads\0.1.5\0.1.5\csv\ecosystem\qgis_exports\

🚀 IMMEDIATE STEPS:

1. OPEN QGIS

2. ADD THESE 3 LAYERS (in this order):

   LAYER 1 - Performance Raster (background):
   - File: performance_interpolation_20250724_014920.tif
   - Layer → Add Layer → Add Raster Layer
   - Style: Use "Spectral" color ramp, set transparency to 70%

   LAYER 2 - Cluster Boundaries (polygons):
   - File: cluster_boundaries_20250724_014920.shp  
   - Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer
   - Style: No fill, thick outline, different color per cluster

   LAYER 3 - Site Points (on top):
   - File: sapflux_sites_20250724_014920.geojson
   - Layer → Add Layer → Add Vector Layer
   - Style: Color by "eco_clust" field, size by "spatial_r2" field

3. RIGHT-CLICK each layer → "Open Attribute Table" to see the data

4. USE IDENTIFY TOOL (i button) to click on features and see values

🎯 WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
- 87 sites across 5 ecosystem clusters
- Model performance varies geographically  
- Clusters have distinct climate characteristics
- Some areas have better model performance than others

📊 KEY ATTRIBUTES TO EXPLORE:
- eco_clust: Ecosystem cluster (0-4)
- spatial_r2: Model performance (higher = better)
- temp_c: Mean annual temperature
- precip_mm: Mean annual precipitation
- elevation: Site elevation

💡 QUICK ANALYSIS IDEAS:
- Which cluster has the best model performance?
- Do warmer/cooler sites perform differently?
- Are there geographic patterns in performance?
- Which individual sites are outliers?
