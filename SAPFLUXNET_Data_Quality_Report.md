# SAPFLUXNET Data Quality Analysis Report

## Understanding Site Performance in Spatial Validation Models

**Analysis Date:** July 25, 2025  
**Focus Site:** COL_MAC_SAF_RAD (Macagual Universidad de la Amazonia)  
**Dataset:** 165 SAPFLUXNET sites  

---

## Executive Summary

Our comprehensive analysis revealed that **COL_MAC_SAF_RAD's poor performance in spatial validation is not due to environmental data quality issues but rather insufficient temporal coverage**. While the site has excellent environmental data quality with no problematic zero values or missing data issues, it contains only **13.2 days** of measurements, making it inadequate for robust spatial modeling.

### Key Findings

- ‚úÖ **Good Data Quality**: COL_MAC_SAF_RAD has 100% environmental variable coverage with no excessive zero values
- ‚ùå **Insufficient Temporal Coverage**: Only 13.2 days vs. required minimum of 30+ days for spatial modeling
- üìä **Rare Problem**: Only 3 out of 165 sites (1.8%) have insufficient temporal coverage
- üéØ **Root Cause**: Temporal sampling inadequacy, not data quality issues

## Impact on Spatial Modeling

### Why Temporal Coverage Matters for Spatial Models

**Environmental Gradient Representation**:

- 13.2 days cannot capture seasonal environmental variability
- Limited range of weather conditions (only mid-January period)
- Insufficient temperature, humidity, and radiation gradients
- No representation of plant physiological responses across conditions

**Model Training Implications**:

- **Feature Space Coverage**: Narrow environmental feature space limits model generalization
- **Relationship Learning**: Insufficient data to learn robust environment-sap flow relationships
- **Spatial Extrapolation**: Poor representation for predicting at other locations
- **Validation Performance**: Expected poor performance in spatial validation due to limited training data representativeness

### Comparison with High-Performing Sites

**Well-Represented Sites (>365 days)**:

- USA_MOR_SF: 793 days - captures multiple seasons and environmental cycles
- FIN_HYY_SME: 435 days - represents full annual cycles including winter conditions
- DEU_STE_4P5: 417 days - captures complete seasonal transitions

**These sites provide**:

- Full seasonal environmental gradients
- Complete plant physiological response ranges
- Robust training data for spatial extrapolation
- High spatial validation performance

## Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions

**For COL_MAC_SAF_RAD Specifically**:

- ‚ùå **Exclude from spatial model training** due to insufficient temporal coverage
- ‚úÖ **Use as validation/test site only** if additional data collection is not possible
- üîÑ **Prioritize for extended data collection** if site is still accessible

**For Current Spatial Models**:

- Remove the 3 sites with <30 days coverage from training datasets
- Focus training on the 140 sites with >90 days coverage
- Use short-coverage sites only for validation or sensitivity analysis

### 2. Site Selection Criteria for Future Spatial Models

**Minimum Requirements**:

- **Temporal Coverage**: ‚â•90 days (preferably ‚â•180 days)
- **Seasonal Representation**: Data spanning multiple seasons or environmental conditions
- **Environmental Variable Completeness**: ‚â•80% of critical variables present
- **Data Quality**: <20% missing data across critical variables

**Optimal Sites for Spatial Model Training**:

- Sites with ‚â•365 days coverage (16 sites available)
- Sites with 90-365 days but good seasonal coverage (124 sites available)
- Prioritize sites with diverse environmental conditions and geographic distribution

### 3. Data Collection Strategy

**For Existing Short-Coverage Sites**:

- Assess feasibility of returning to collect additional data
- Prioritize sites in underrepresented geographic regions or biomes
- Consider partnerships with local institutions for ongoing monitoring

**For New Site Establishment**:

- Plan minimum 1-year measurement campaigns
- Ensure coverage of key seasonal transitions
- Include multiple weather cycles (dry/wet seasons, temperature extremes)

## Conclusions

1. **COL_MAC_SAF_RAD is not a "bad data" problem** - it's an "insufficient data" problem
2. **Environmental data quality is excellent** across most SAPFLUXNET sites when timestamp issues are ignored
3. **Temporal coverage is the critical factor** determining site suitability for spatial modeling
4. **Very few sites have inadequate coverage** - this is a manageable data curation issue
5. **Clear site selection criteria** can significantly improve spatial model performance

The analysis demonstrates that **spatial model performance issues can often be resolved through better site selection based on temporal coverage criteria rather than complex data cleaning procedures**. Focusing training datasets on the 140 sites with adequate temporal coverage (‚â•90 days) should substantially improve spatial validation performance.
