# Transpiration ML Project Analysis & Improvement Strategy

## Project Overview

This document analyzes a transpiration prediction project that uses machine learning to predict sap flux (transpiration rates) from environmental variables. The current implementation uses Random Forest models, but significant improvements are possible through better temporal modeling and advanced ML approaches.

### Current Data Characteristics

- **Temporal Resolution**: Hourly environmental measurements
- **Data Volume**: ~1.8M observations across 90+ sites
- **Features**: ta (temperature), vpd (vapor pressure deficit), ppfd_in (photosynthetic flux), swc_shallow (soil water content)
- **Target**: Sap flux (transpiration rate) in cm³/s
- **Sites**: Diverse biomes (Temperate forest, Boreal forest, Tropical rain forest, etc.)

### Current RandomForest Implementation

#### Key Components

1. **`random_forest.py`**: Single model training for specific clusters
2. **`rf_optimization.py`**: Batch training across all clusters
3. **Clustering**: Pre-computed clusters by biome, functional type, and K-means

#### Current Approach Limitations

```python
# Current RF approach issues
limitations = {
    'temporal_ignorance': 'Treats each time point independently',
    'static_clustering': 'Fixed clusters, no learning',
    'limited_features': 'Only 4 basic environmental variables',
    'no_uncertainty': 'Point predictions only',
    'overfitting_risk': 'Limited regularization',
    'manual_selection': 'Requires choosing which cluster to model'
}
```

#### Current Performance

From RF results analysis:

- **Best performing**: Tropical forest savanna (R² = 0.899)
- **Worst performing**: k_means_0 cluster (R² = 0.481)
- **Average performance**: R² ~0.6-0.8 across most clusters

## Identified Problems & Opportunities

### 1. Temporal Dependencies Ignored

**Problem**: Transpiration has strong temporal patterns (diurnal cycles, seasonal trends, lagged effects)
**Impact**: Missing critical predictive information
**Solution**: Add temporal features and proper time series modeling

### 2. Static Clustering Approach

**Problem**: Pre-computed clusters lose information and require manual model selection
**Impact**: Inefficient, doesn't leverage cross-cluster relationships
**Solution**: Learnable hierarchical modeling or soft clustering

### 3. Limited Feature Engineering

**Problem**: Only uses 4 basic environmental variables
**Impact**: Missing important interactions and derived features
**Solution**: Comprehensive feature engineering with temporal and interaction features

### 4. No Uncertainty Quantification

**Problem**: Single point predictions without confidence intervals
**Impact**: Limited practical utility for decision-making
**Solution**: Probabilistic modeling approaches
