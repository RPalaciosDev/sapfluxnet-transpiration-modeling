The article introduces **SAPFLUXNET, the first global compilation of whole-plant transpiration data derived from sap flow measurements**. Transpiration is a critical component of the global water cycle, accounting for 40% of global land precipitation and 70% of total land evapotranspiration. It links vegetation's physiological responses to water supply and demand with hydrological, energy, and carbon budgets. Despite its importance, transpiration and its response to environmental factors have been poorly constrained by observations and inadequately represented in models. SAPFLUXNET was developed to address this significant gap by compiling and harmonizing a large volume of previously scattered sap flow data.

### Key Aspects of SAPFLUXNET

* **Purpose**: The database aims to enhance the understanding of plant water use, plant responses to drought, and ecohydrological processes by providing a **global, harmonized dataset of whole-plant transpiration**. It is designed to facilitate global syntheses and comparative studies across diverse species and regions.
* **Content and Scope**:
  * SAPFLUXNET version 0.1.5 contains **202 globally distributed datasets** from 121 geographical locations.
  * It includes **sub-daily time series of sap flow** (water movement through the plant's xylem) and associated **hydrometeorological drivers** for one or more growing seasons.
  * The database features data for **2714 individual plants**, primarily trees, belonging to **174 species**, 95 genera, and 45 families. Only one non-tree species, *Elaeis guineensis* (a palm), is included.
  * The measurements span from **1995 to 2018**, with 50% of datasets being at least 3 years long, offering insights into seasonal and diel (daily) patterns of water use.
* **Data Acquisition and Processing**:
  * Datasets were **community-contributed** and had to meet minimum criteria, including processed sub-daily sap flow data representative of whole-plant water use, along with ecological and technical metadata.
  * A **semi-automatic data workflow** implemented in the R programming language was used for **harmonization and quality control (QC1 and QC2)**. This involved checks for inconsistencies, outlier detection, range checks, unit transformations, and calculation of derived variables.
  * The output is stored in **self-contained R objects** (`sfn_data` class) or as CSV files, including data, metadata, and data flags.
* **Sap Flow Measurement Methods**:
  * Sap flow methods, which track heat applied to sapwood, provide estimates of water flow through plants.
  * They are broadly classified into **heat dissipation methods** (e.g., constant heat dissipation (HD), transient heat dissipation (CHD), heat deformation (HFD)), **heat pulse methods** (e.g., compensation heat pulse (CHP), heat ratio (HR), T-max (HPTM), Sapflow+), and **heat balance methods** (e.g., trunk sector heat balance (TSHB), stem heat balance (SHB)).
  * The **HD method is the most frequent** in SAPFLUXNET (66.4% of plants), followed by TSHB (16.4%) and CHP (8.4%).
  * Sap flow rates can be expressed per individual plant, per unit sapwood area, or per unit leaf area. Most data in SAPFLUXNET are available at the whole-plant level.
  * **Species-specific calibrations are largely absent** in the database for most methods, which can affect the accuracy of absolute sap flow rates for methods like HD, known to underestimate flow. Radial and azimuthal integration to account for sap flow variation within stems are also not consistently applied across all methods, although some methods (CHP, HR, SHB, TSHB) address radial variation more frequently.
* **Data Coverage and Characteristics**:
  * **Bioclimatic Coverage**: Broad, with **woodland/shrubland and temperate forest biomes particularly well-represented** (80% of datasets). Tropical and boreal forests are less represented.
  * **Vegetation Types**: Evergreen needleleaf forest (65 datasets), deciduous broadleaf forest (47 datasets), and evergreen broadleaf forest (43 datasets) are the most common.
  * **Species and Genera**: *Pinus* and *Quercus* are the most represented genera. Key species include *Pinus sylvestris*, *Picea abies*, *Pinus taeda* (gymnosperms), *Acer saccharum*, *Fagus sylvatica*, and *Populus tremuloides* (angiosperms).
  * **Plant Characteristics**: The database covers a wide range of plant sizes, with detailed metadata on diameter at breast height (DBH), height, sapwood area, and sapwood depth.
  * **Stand Characteristics**: Includes metadata on management (unmanaged, managed, plantations, orchards), age, height, density, basal area, leaf area index (LAI), and soil properties. Half of the datasets come from naturally regenerated, unmanaged stands.
  * **Environmental Data**: All datasets include ancillary time series of key hydrometeorological drivers like air temperature, vapour pressure deficit (VPD), radiation, wind speed, precipitation, and soil water content (shallow and deep).
* **Applications**:
  * **Plant Ecophysiology and Functional Ecology**: Enables assessment of whole-plant water use rates and their environmental sensitivity across and within species. Useful for studying plant responses to drought, post-drought recovery patterns, and within-day patterns like circadian rhythms and hysteresis. It supports analyses of night-time water use and the effects of biotic/abiotic disturbances or experimental treatments (e.g., thinning, irrigation, wildfire). It can also be combined with other databases (e.g., Dendroglobal, International Tree-Ring Data Bank) for integrated analyses of growth, water use, and carbon assimilation.
  * **Ecosystem Ecology and Ecohydrology**: Provides a global view of plant water flows, bridging scales between plant traits and ecosystem fluxes. Can be used to understand global controls on vegetation water use, partitioning of evapotranspiration, and for "ground-truth" reference for remote sensing and eddy covariance data. Facilitates understanding species interactions regarding water use and validating ecosystem and terrestrial biosphere models. Upscaling individual measurements to the stand level is possible for many datasets, particularly for species comprising a large percentage of stand basal area.
* **Limitations and Future Directions**:
  * **Methodological Uncertainty**: Sap flow data processing varies, leading to methodological uncertainty. A full, standardized raw-to-processed data workflow is challenging.
  * **Absolute Flow Accuracy**: Some methods, notably the most common HD method, can significantly underestimate water flows without species-specific calibration. Within-plant spatial variation in sap flow is also often not fully accounted for. The method for quantifying sapwood area, a source of error, is not provided as metadata.
  * **Spatial and Taxonomic Gaps**: While global, coverage is still sparse in some forested regions, particularly boreal and tropical forests. There is also a lack of data for extremely tall trees or other growth forms like shrubs and lianas.
  * **Outlook**: Future developments include robust algorithms for gap-filling, application of machine-learning for identifying drivers and producing global transpiration maps, and expansion of the database with new contributions and standardized practices.
* **Accessibility**: SAPFLUXNET version 0.1.5 is freely available from the Zenodo repository (<https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3971689>), with data provided as CSV and RData objects. An R package, 'sapfluxnetr', is also available for easy access, selection, aggregation, and visualization of the data. The initiative aligns with open science practices to promote data sharing and reproducibility.
