## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Plant Transpiration and Global Water Cycle

- Transpiration's role: 40% of global land precipitation, 70% of land evapotranspiration
- Critical for climate modeling, forest management, drought prediction
- Traditional measurement limitations and modeling challenges

### 1.2 SAPFLUXNET Database Revolution

- First global compilation of sap flow data (2014-2018)
- 202 datasets, 121 locations, 174 species, 2714 individual plants
- Opportunity for global-scale modeling previously impossible

### 1.3 The Spatial Generalization Problem

- Previous research: predominantly single-site studies
- **Reference**: Recent single-site approach (Agric. Forest Meteorol. 2024, 10.1016/j.agrformet.2024.110379)
- **Critical gap**: No global spatial validation frameworks exist
- Universal models fail catastrophically at novel locations

### 1.4 Research Objectives

1. Develop ecosystem-based clustering approach for global transpiration data
2. Implement rigorous spatial validation using Leave-One-Site-Out methodology
3. Quantify spatial generalization performance across different ecosystem types
4. Demonstrate superiority over universal modeling approaches

- Multi-scale temporal patterns (3h to 30 days)
- Statistics: mean, std, min, max, range
- Variables: temperature, humidity, VPD, solar radiation

#### Lagged Features (48)
