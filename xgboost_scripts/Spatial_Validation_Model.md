# Spatial Validation Model for SAPFLUXNET Data

## Overview

The Spatial Validation Model uses **Leave-One-Site-Out cross-validation** to rigorously test the **spatial generalization capability** of machine learning models predicting sap flow from environmental and temporal features. This model answers the critical research question: **"Can we reliably predict sap flow at completely new sites we've never seen before?"**

## Primary Research Question

**"How well can we predict sap flow at new geographic locations using models trained on other sites?"**

This addresses the fundamental challenge in ecological modeling: whether patterns learned from existing study sites can accurately predict ecosystem responses at unstudied locations across different environmental conditions and geographic contexts.

## Methodology

### Leave-One-Site-Out Cross-Validation Approach

- **Site-Based Splitting**: Each fold holds out one complete site for testing
- **Multi-Site Training**: Trains on all remaining sites (N-1 sites)
- **Geographic Independence**: No data leakage between spatially distinct locations
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Every site is tested as a "new" location

### Validation Strategy

```
Site 1: Train on [Sites 2,3,4...N] ‚Üí Test on [Site 1]
Site 2: Train on [Sites 1,3,4...N] ‚Üí Test on [Site 2]
Site 3: Train on [Sites 1,2,4...N] ‚Üí Test on [Site 3]
...
Site N: Train on [Sites 1,2,3...N-1] ‚Üí Test on [Site N]
```

Each fold simulates deploying a model to a completely new geographic location with unknown characteristics.

## Key Features

- **158 Engineered Features**: Environmental patterns, temporal dynamics, but **excludes site identity**
- **Conservative XGBoost**: Identical parameters to other validation models for fair comparison
- **Global Coverage**: Validates across ~106 SAPFLUXNET sites worldwide
- **Memory Management**: Configurable limits for computational constraints
