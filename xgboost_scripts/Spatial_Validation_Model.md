# Spatial Validation Model for SAPFLUXNET Data

## Overview

The Spatial Validation Model uses **Leave-One-Site-Out cross-validation with balanced site sampling** to rigorously test the **spatial generalization capability** of machine learning models predicting sap flow from environmental and temporal features. This enhanced model combines **geographic fairness** with **external memory efficiency** to answer the critical research question: **"Can we reliably predict sap flow at completely new sites we've never seen before?"**

## Primary Research Question

**"How well can we predict sap flow at new geographic locations using models trained on other sites with balanced geographic representation?"**

This addresses the fundamental challenge in ecological modeling: whether patterns learned from existing study sites can accurately predict ecosystem responses at unstudied locations across different environmental conditions and geographic contexts, while ensuring that all sites contribute equally to model learning regardless of their data volume.

## Enhanced Methodology

### Balanced Site Sampling + Leave-One-Site-Out Cross-Validation

Our enhanced approach combines two key innovations:

#### 1. **Balanced Site Sampling for Geographic Fairness**

- **Equal Contribution**: Each site contributes ~3000 records (or all available if less)
- **Geographic Equity**: Prevents high-data sites from dominating model patterns
- **Quality Filtering**: Excludes sites with <500 records for reliability
- **Substantial Data**: Still uses ~300K+ total records across all sites

#### 2. **External Memory Efficiency**

- **Memory Scalable**: Uses libsvm format for unlimited dataset size handling
- **Computational Feasible**: LOSO training on balanced data is much faster
- **Enhanced Features**: Feature mapping provides both indices and names
- **Disk Management**: Automatic cleanup and space monitoring

### Validation Strategy

```
Site 1: Train on [3K records from Sites 2,3,4...N] ‚Üí Test on [Site 1: all records]
Site 2: Train on [3K records from Sites 1,3,4...N] ‚Üí Test on [Site 2: all records]
Site 3: Train on [3K records from Sites 1,2,4...N] ‚Üí Test on [Site 3: all records]
...
Site N: Train on [3K records from Sites 1,2,3...N-1] ‚Üí Test on [Site N: all records]
```

Each fold simulates deploying a model to a completely new geographic location, but with **balanced geographic representation** in the training data rather than bias toward high-data sites.

## Key Features

- **158 Engineered Features**: Environmental patterns, temporal dynamics, but **excludes site identity**
- **Balanced Geographic Training**: ~3000 records per site for fair representation
- **External Memory XGBoost**: Memory-efficient training with libsvm format
- **Enhanced Feature Mapping**: Both feature indices (f107) and names (rh_mean_3h)
- **Global Coverage**: Validates across ~100+ SAPFLUXNET sites worldwide
- **Geographic Fairness**: Equal site contribution regardless of original data volume

## Scientific Advantages of Balanced Sampling

### **Geographic Fairness**

```
