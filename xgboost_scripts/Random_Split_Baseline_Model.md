# Random Split Baseline Model for SAPFLUXNET Data

## Overview

The Random Split Baseline Model serves as the **performance ceiling benchmark** for machine learning models predicting sap flow from environmental and temporal features. This model answers the fundamental question: **"What is the maximum achievable performance when temporal constraints are removed?"**

**Now available in both traditional and external memory versions** for enhanced scalability and memory efficiency.

## Primary Research Question

**"What is the upper bound of predictive performance for sap flow modeling when we ignore temporal ordering?"**

This establishes the theoretical performance ceiling by allowing the model to learn from randomly distributed data, potentially including information "leakage" from future to past periods.

## Methodology

### Random 80/20 Split Approach

- **Random Sampling**: All data points are randomly shuffled before splitting
- **Traditional ML Validation**: Uses standard 80% train / 20% test division
- **No Temporal Constraints**: Future data can inform predictions of past events
- **Optimistic Benchmark**: Represents "best case scenario" performance

### Validation Strategy

```
All Data Points (Randomly Shuffled)
├── Training Set (80%): Random sample from all time periods
└── Test Set (20%): Random sample from all time periods
```

This approach mimics traditional machine learning validation but ignores the temporal nature of ecological data.

### External Memory Enhancement
