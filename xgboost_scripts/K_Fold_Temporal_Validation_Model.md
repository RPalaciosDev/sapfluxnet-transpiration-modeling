# K-Fold Temporal Validation Model for SAPFLUXNET Data

## Overview

The K-Fold Temporal Validation Model is designed to rigorously test the **temporal generalization capability** of machine learning models predicting sap flow from environmental and temporal features. This model answers the critical research question: **"Can we reliably predict sap flow in future years based on historical data?"**

**Now available in both traditional and external memory versions** for enhanced scalability and memory efficiency while maintaining strict temporal validation.

## Primary Research Question

**"How well can we predict sap flow in future time periods using models trained on historical data?"**

This addresses the fundamental challenge in ecological forecasting: whether patterns learned from past observations can accurately predict future ecosystem responses.

## Methodology

### K-Fold Temporal Cross-Validation Approach

- **Multiple Temporal Splits**: Creates 5 consecutive temporal folds across the time series
- **Progressive Training**: Each fold uses all data before its test period for training
- **Future Testing**: Each fold tests on a different "future" time period
- **No Data Leakage**: Strict temporal ordering prevents future information from influencing past predictions

### Validation Strategy

```
Fold 1: Train on [Time 0 → 20%] → Test on [20% → 40%]
Fold 2: Train on [Time 0 → 40%] → Test on [40% → 60%]
Fold 3: Train on [Time 0 → 60%] → Test on [60% → 80%]
Fold 4: Train on [Time 0 → 80%] → Test on [80% → 100%]
```

Each fold simulates a real-world scenario where we train on historical data and predict future periods.

```
Example: Test R² = 0.85 ± 0.03 (Traditional) or 0.87 ± 0.03 (External Memory)
```

**Interpretation**:

```

**Interpretation**:

```

**Interpretation**:
