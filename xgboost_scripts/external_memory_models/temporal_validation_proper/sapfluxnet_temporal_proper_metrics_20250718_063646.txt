Fold 5: Test R² = -0.3394, Test RMSE = 5.1337

Validation Method:
------------------
- K-fold temporal cross-validation using real timestamps
- File-based temporal splitting (no synthetic timestamps)
- Chunked processing for memory efficiency
- External memory training for large datasets
- Strict temporal ordering maintained
- No data leakage from future to past
