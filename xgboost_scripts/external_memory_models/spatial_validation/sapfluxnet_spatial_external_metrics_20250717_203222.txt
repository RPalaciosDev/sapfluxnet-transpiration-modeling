Completed Folds: 87/87

Validation Method:
------------------
- Leave-One-Site-Out spatial cross-validation
- Balanced site sampling for geographic fairness
- External memory for computational efficiency
- Each site contributes equally to model learning
- Tests true spatial generalization capability
- No geographic bias from high-data sites

Advantages of This Approach:
------------------------------
- Geographic fairness: Equal site representation
- Substantial data: ~3000 records per site
- Memory efficient: External memory processing
- Scientifically sound: Tests NEW site prediction
- Computationally feasible: Manageable fold sizes
- Balanced evaluation: No big-site dominance
