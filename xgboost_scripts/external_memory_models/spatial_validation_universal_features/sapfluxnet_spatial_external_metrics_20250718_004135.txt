SAPFLUXNET Spatial External Memory Training Results (NO GEOGRAPHIC PROXIES)
======================================================================
Training completed: 2025-07-18 00:41:35.519448
Method: Leave-One-Site-Out with balanced sampling + external memory
Approach: Fair spatial generalization WITHOUT geographic proxy features
Original dataset: 8,692,194 rows
Balanced dataset: 252,066 rows from 87 sites
Geographic fairness: Equal contribution from each site
Feature modification: Excluded geographic proxies to test universal generalization

  train_r2_std: 0.0610
  test_r2_mean: -612.6943
  test_r2_std: 5654.6623

Completed Folds: 87/87

Validation Method:
------------------
- Leave-One-Site-Out spatial cross-validation
- Balanced site sampling for geographic fairness
- External memory for computational efficiency
- Each site contributes equally to model learning
- Tests true spatial generalization capability
- No geographic bias from high-data sites

Advantages of This Approach:
------------------------------
- Geographic fairness: Equal site representation
- Substantial data: ~3000 records per site
- Memory efficient: External memory processing
- Scientifically sound: Tests NEW site prediction
- Computationally feasible: Manageable fold sizes
- Balanced evaluation: No big-site dominance
