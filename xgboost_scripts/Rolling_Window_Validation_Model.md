# Rolling Window Validation Model for SAPFLUXNET Data

## Overview

The Rolling Window Validation Model implements **time series forecasting validation** to rigorously test the **short-term forecasting capability** and **seasonal predictability patterns** of machine learning models predicting sap flow. This model answers critical operational questions: **"Can we predict sap flow days/weeks ahead for forest management?"** and **"How do seasonal patterns affect our forecasting accuracy?"**

## Primary Research Questions

1. **"How well can we predict sap flow in the near future (7 days ahead) using recent historical data?"**
2. **"Which seasons provide the most reliable short-term forecasting?"**
3. **"How does forecasting accuracy change during seasonal transitions?"**

This addresses the fundamental challenge in operational forest hydrology: whether machine learning models can provide reliable short-term predictions for water use planning, drought monitoring, and forest management decisions.

## Methodology

### Rolling Window Time Series Validation

- **Sliding Windows**: Multiple 30-day training windows that progress through time
- **Consistent Forecast Horizon**: Each window predicts 7 days into the future
- **Temporal Progression**: Windows slide forward to test different time periods
- **No Data Leakage**: Strict temporal ordering prevents future information from influencing past predictions

### Validation Strategy

```
Window 1: Train [Day 1-30] → Forecast [Day 31-37]
Window 2: Train [Day 38-67] → Forecast [Day 68-74]
Window 3: Train [Day 75-104] → Forecast [Day 105-111]
...
Window N: Train [Day X-X+29] → Forecast [Day X+30-X+36]
```

Each window simulates an operational forecasting scenario where recent data is used to predict immediate future conditions.

- Climate change may alter seasonal predictability patterns

### ⚠️ **Environmental Dependencies**

## Integration with Validation Framework

### Four-Model Validation Strategy

1. **Random Baseline**: Performance ceiling (no constraints)
2. **K-Fold Temporal**: Tests future year prediction
3. **Spatial Validation**: Tests new site prediction
4. **Rolling Window** ← This model: Tests operational forecasting

### Comparative Insights Matrix

```
High Rolling Window + High Temporal = Strong overall predictability
High Rolling Window + Low Temporal = Short-term only predictability  
Low Rolling Window + High Temporal = Long-term patterns only
Low Rolling Window + Low Temporal = Limited predictability overall
```

### Operational Deployment Decision Tree

```
Rolling Window R² > 0.70 + Spatial R² > 0.60 = Ready for operational deployment
Rolling Window R² > 0.70 + Spatial R² < 0.60 = Site-specific operational use
Rolling Window R² < 0.70 + Any Spatial = Research only, not operational
```
