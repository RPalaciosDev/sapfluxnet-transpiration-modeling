## Technical Requirements

### Dependencies

```python
required_packages = [
    'xgboost>=1.7.0',
    'pandas>=1.5.0',
    'numpy>=1.21.0',
    'scikit-learn>=1.1.0',
    'matplotlib>=3.5.0',
    'seaborn>=0.11.0'
]
```

### Data Requirements

- Hourly environmental data (already available)
- Sap flux measurements (already available)
- Site metadata (already available)
- Temporal coverage: Minimum 1 month per site (most sites exceed this)

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics

1. **R² Score**: >0.8 for most biomes (vs current ~0.6-0.8)
2. **MAE**: <500 cm³/s for most sites
3. **Temporal Consistency**: Predictions follow realistic diurnal patterns
4. **Uncertainty Calibration**: 90% confidence intervals contain 90% of actual values

### Secondary Metrics

1. **Feature Importance**: Temporal features should rank highly
2. **Cross-Site Generalization**: Models should work across similar biomes
3. **Computational Efficiency**: Training time <2 hours for full dataset
4. **Robustness**: Performance maintained with missing data

## Clustering Strategy

### Current Clustering Assessment

The current clustering approach has limitations but can be valuable if implemented differently:

**Current Issues:**

- Static, pre-computed clusters
- Loss of information through discrete buckets
- Manual model selection required

**Better Approaches:**

1. **Hierarchical Modeling**: Use clusters as learnable hierarchical structure
2. **Soft Clustering**: Learnable cluster assignments with attention mechanisms
3. **Multi-Task Learning**: Clusters as auxiliary tasks

**Recommendation**: Keep clustering but implement as learnable hierarchical structure rather than separate models.

## Conclusion

The current Random Forest implementation provides a solid baseline but has significant limitations in temporal modeling and overall performance. XGBoost with proper temporal feature engineering represents a major upgrade that should provide:

1. **20-30% improvement in prediction accuracy**
2. **Better temporal pattern capture**
3. **Uncertainty quantification**
4. **More robust and interpretable models**

The dataset is well-suited for this approach, with sufficient temporal depth and volume to train sophisticated models. The implementation should focus on temporal feature engineering, proper cross-validation, and multi-site modeling to maximize the value of the available data.

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Start with temporal feature engineering** - This provides the biggest immediate gains
2. **Implement basic XGBoost** - Replace RF as a drop-in replacement
3. **Add temporal cross-validation** - Ensure proper temporal validation
4. **Implement multi-site modeling** - Handle site heterogeneity
5. **Add uncertainty quantification** - Provide confidence intervals
6. **Comprehensive evaluation** - Compare against current RF implementation

This approach should result in a significantly more accurate and useful transpiration prediction system.

## Key Insights for Another Agent

### Project Context

- **Goal**: Predict transpiration rates from environmental variables
- **Current State**: Basic Random Forest implementation with static clustering
- **Data**: Rich hourly environmental data across 90+ sites, 1.8M observations
- **Limitations**: No temporal modeling, limited features, no uncertainty quantification

### Recommended Approach

1. **XGBoost with temporal features** - Major performance improvement expected
2. **Hierarchical modeling** - Better than static clustering
3. **Temporal cross-validation** - Essential for time series data
4. **Multi-site ensemble** - Handle site heterogeneity

### Expected Outcomes

- 20-30% improvement in R² scores
- Better temporal pattern capture
- Uncertainty quantification
- More robust and interpretable models

The dataset is well-suited for advanced ML approaches, and the current implementation is quite basic - significant improvements are achievable with proper temporal modeling and modern ML techniques.
